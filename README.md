### About me
I am currently learning coding through a Skills Bootcamp run by HyperionDev, with a focus on Data Science and Python.
I have no previous background in coding and I'm currently working as a Medical Laboratory Assistant so at the moment I still have a lot to learn and practice.
**Any advice on how to improve is more than welcome!** ðŸ˜…

Some of the concepts I've grown familiar with so far include:
- Data types
- Conditional statements
- Iterations
- User defined functions
- Lists and dictionaries
